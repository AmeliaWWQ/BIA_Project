### *Feedback from March 29 presentation*
- Provide more clinical knowledge on glaucoma, for example, what kind of imaging features in retinal fundus images distinguish referable cases from non-referable cases?
- Do a literature review on how related works solve glaucoma diagnosis probelms.
- Refine the research hypothesis to, say, "Machine learning models can detect disease-specific imaging features to accurately classify non-referable and referable glaucoma".
- From Dr. Yan: we are doing blind classification... (hhh)
